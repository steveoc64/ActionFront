<h2>Chapitre 9 - Grand Tactical Movement</h2>

<h3>9.1 Overview</h3>

There is natural friction that occurs when 2 armies come grip with each other. When out of immediate danger, troops were able to more efficiently do tasks, such as marching, than when bullets were flying around their heads. This phase represents the accordion effect of time as the two armies maneuver. Four primary activities take place in Grand Tactical Movement :
<ul>
	<li>Marching</li>
	<li>Deploying</li>
	<li>Grand Tactical Adjustments</li>
	<li>Retrograde Movement</li>
</ul>

Grand Tactical Adjustments are performed after all other Grand Tactical Movement is completed.

<h3>9.2 Deployment</h3>

In R&E, each ME is considered to be in one of 6 deployment states :

<ul>
	<li>Extended Campaign Column</li>
	<li>Regular Campaign Column</li>
	<li>Condensed Campaign Column</li>
	<li>Partially Deployed</li>
	<li>Brigade Out (with remainder deploying)</li>
	<li>Fully Deployed</li>
</ul>

ME's advance up and down between these states depending on whether they trying to deploy from the march, or to get into a march column.
