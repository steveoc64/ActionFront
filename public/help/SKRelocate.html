		Once unformed units, not operating in close support of a parent battalion, are deployed they do not automatically move.

		<p><p>
		While the initial turn in which the light companies breaking away from their parent unit, or an entire unit breaking into unformed order, full movement is allowed, thereafter the unformed companies must roll to see if they are able to move.

		<p><p>
		This excludes any movement brought about by an enemy advancing or charging and forcing the unformed units to retire.

		<p><p>
		The procedure is that the player rolls for each units unformed companies, and consults the Unformed Relocation Table.

		<p><p>
		Results of the table are as follows :
			<ul>
				<li>No Move / Retire - means that no move may be made, unless it is to retire behind the parent unit.</li>
				<li>Move - means that all the unformed companies may advance against the enemy. This move may not penetrate the enemy base line.</li>
				<li>Bold - means that the unformed companies may move to their full allowance, up to the maximum support distance from their parent unit. They may penetrate the enemy baseline, and may even charge enemy units if so desired.
			</ul>
