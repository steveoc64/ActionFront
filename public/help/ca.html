	<div class="panel-body">
		Standard ground scale in Revolution and Empire is 1" = 40yds, and 1 "Turn" represents 30 minutes of elapsed time. Playing the game in fully manual control mode, the players
		move each unit about the tabletop with a resolution of inches, and use tape measures to determine ranges, etc.
		<p>
		<p>
		Using the computerized movement mode, this is simplified into a Grid system, where each Grid Square is approx 1/4 mile. When setting up the game, you can choose 
		any size grid that suits, based on the size of the battlefield and the available table space. As an effect of this, the definition of an "inch", when using the
		computerized mode, is always exactly 1/10th the size of a grid.
		<p>
		When moving troops using the computerized movement mode, the computer will track the actual movement of each unit down to the nearest "inch" within each grid.
		At various points during the game, as units progress from one "grid" to another on the virtual battlefield  ... the computer will instruct players to advance certain units
		to the next tabletop grid, etc.
		<p>
		This makes tabletop movement much faster and simpler, and avoids gamey geometry issues .. allowing players to concentrate on the general situation, and make full use of the tabletop and miniatures as an aesthetic representation, without impacting game play.

		Grand Tactical Movement is used to move unengaged ME sized formations around the battlefield.
		<p><p>
		Grand Tactical Movement ends when the ME in question moves to within engagement range of the enemy. 
		<p><p>
		Engagement Ranges for different ME types are :
		<ul>
			<li>Infantry and Mixed MEs - moving into any grid which is directly or diagonally adjacent to an enemy occupied grid</li>
			<li>Cavalry MEs - moving into any grid which within 2 direct grids, or 1 diagonally adjacent grid to an enemy occupied grid</li>

	<div class="panel-body">
		Deployment movement is used to move troops that are currently in march columns, into tactical formations and lines of battle.
		<p><p>
		Ideally, you should begin deployment around a mile from the enemy position, issue orders, and then begin any offensive operations.
		<p><p>
		Some scenarios however will produce battles that see one or both sides 'caught on the march', due to poor conditions, poor preparation, or both.

		The sequence of events during Tactical Movement includes :
		<ul>
			<li>Determine Initiative - the order in which various Corps elect to perform tactical operations.</li>
			<li>Initiative Player Tactical Movement - For each friendly ME, execute a series of tactical moves until complete.</li>
			<li>When executing tactical movement for a given ME, groups of sub-units may be selected for action. When an action fails, or is defeated by enemy reaction, the tactical move for the whole ME is complete this turn.</li>

	<div class="panel-heading"><h2>Skirmishers</h2></div>
	<div class="panel-body">
		Controlling skirmishers in a Grand Tactical level Napoleonic Game requires some special handling.

		<p><p>
		At the higher level, there may be ME level skirmisher screens, made up of open order elements contributed from many sub units. These can be used to screen an entire Division, or conduct Divisional level Grande Bande preparatory attacks prior to a general assualt. We need to be able to handle this aspect of grand skirmishing in the game.

		<p><p>
		At the tactical level, each Battalion may have it's own integral skirmisher companies deployed in full skirmish order, or may have an entire 3rd rank from it's line deployed as an open order screen. We need to be able to handle this aspect of the petite guerre in the game as well. In general, detached skirmishers must remain within support distance of the parent unit in order to be controlled by that parent unit. 

		<p><p>
		Integral skirmishers that are deployed anywhere in the same grid as their parent unit are considered to be under direct control of the parent unit.

		<p><p>
		Integral skirmishers that are deployed anywhere in the next grid in front of their parent unit are considered to be operating at the limit of their control. If they wish to do anything other than shoot at the enemy in the same grid square, then they must test on the skirmisher relocation table. The results of this test are limited to :
		<ul>
			<li>They decide to withdraw back to the same grid as the parent unit</li>
			<li>They act accordingly (but cannot move any further out)</li>
			<li>They go 'Bold', do a Captain Sharpe, and can take any desired action up to 3 grid squares distant of their parent unit</li>
		</ul>

	<div class="panel-heading"><h2>Built up Areas</h2></div>
	<div class="panel-body">
		Built up areas (BUAs) offer a special challenge to Grand Tactical level games. To make it more complicated, different armies had different tactics and training to deal with the organised defense of towns. In this system, each unit has an additional 'street fighting' rating which affects how it behaves when fighting in towns.

		<p><p>
		<h4>BUA Storage Capacity</h4>

		<p><p>
		In this system, each BUA can hold up to 2 units at any time. As long as you have at least 1 unit remaining in a section of BUA, you can withdraw a unit, and then commit another unit to take its place. 

		<p><p>
		Each BUA can be considered to be up to 200m x 200m in size.  Each section of BUA then takes up 1 quarter of a Grid square. This would be ideal for a large farm or a village market for example. For a highly dense series of BUAs, such as the centre of a large Town ... up to 4 BUA terrain elements can be jammed together per Grid Square. Each of these in turn can hold up to 2 defending units if need be.

		<p><p>
		<h4>Entering / Exiting a BUA</h4>

		<p><p>
		In order to enter a BUA, the unit must pass the Occupy Structure Test. On success, the unit occupies the structure in good order, and secures good fire lanes and lines of communication. If it fails, the unit occupies the structure in disorder, and passes on the initiative for the turn.

		<p><p>
		In order to leave a BUA, the unit must pass the Exit Structure Test. On success, the unit exits the structure in good order. On partial success, the unit exits the structure in disorder. On failure, the unit remains in the structure, and passes on the initiative for this turn.

	<div class="panel-heading"><h2>Formation Changes</h2></div>
	<div class="panel-body">
		Columns, Lines, Squares ... essential elements of any Napoleonic Battlefield.

		<p><p>
		Armies are Divided into 2 categories for their battlefield drill abilties :
		<ul>
			<li>Ancien Regime - Old School linear tactics, generally based on the Prussian model after the 7YW</li>
			<li>Divisional Systems - Later developments of 'impulse' tactics</li>
		</ul>

		<p><p>
		Within these 2 categories, units are considered one of 2 types for determining their ability to make formation changes when under the pressures of the battlefield :
		<ul>
			<li>Trained - Units that are Regular or better, and have extension training at drill</li>
			<li>Untrained - Units that are Conscript or lower. They are reliable at the basics, but can come unstuck under pressure</li>
		</ul>

		<p><p>
		Finally, there are 4 basic tactical formation types that units can transition between:
		<ul>
			<li>Line. - Lines are generally formed on the left of the regulating company, and it is best to plan your deployment to allow this. There are varied effects from forming Line on the Centre or on the Right as this can lead to inverted order or other forms of parade ground chaos.</li>
			<li>Attack Column - any of the various formations that involve a frontage of anything from 50-100yds, with a number of waves of lines of troops at deployment distance from each other.</li>
			<li>Closed Column - any of the various formations that involve a frontage of anything from 50-100yds, with a number of ranks closed up together to offer protection from cavalry.</li>
			<li>Square - any of the various formations that involve the entire unit closed up tightly in all round defence.</li>
		</ul>

		<p><p>
		It may be noted that none of these formations above can be found as described above in one of the many military regulation manuals from the period. That is not the intention of this system to model those regulations in detail. In this system, we are concerned with the general intentions for the unit that the selected formation conveys, and it's placement with other friendly units in a quarter mile wide grid square to complete the overall picture.
