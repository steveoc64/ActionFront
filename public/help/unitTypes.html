	<div class="panel-body">
		Unit Types are the lowest level building blocks of the armies.
		<p><p>
		There are 3 basic categories of Unit Types used in this system :
		<ul>
			<li>Infantry - where the basic unit is the Battalion, made of around 2-8 bases of troops</li>
			<li>Cavalry - where the basic unit is the Regiment, made of around 2-6 bases of horse</li>
			<li>Artillery - where the basic unit is the Battery, made of around 2-6 bases of guns</li>
		</ul>
		<p><p>
		In addition to the 3 basic unit types, additional figures on the table are used to represent 
		engineers, supply assets, and of course ... commanders.
		<p><p>
		In addition to figures, each army requires a small number of markers which are to be used on thet tabletop.
		These markers are used to represent a number of game elments such as smoke, fire, and movement markers.

	<div class="panel-heading"><h2>Infantry Models and Unit Formations</h2></div>
	<div class="panel-body">
		Infantry Battalions are made up of a number of smaller bases, each of which generally equate to a company of troops. Any consistent basing system can be used - and it is easily possible to accomodate multiple basing 'standards' in the same game, using a small degree of common sense.

		<p><p>
		3 Types of Infantry Bases should be used :
		<ul>
			<li>Full Skirmish / Single Figure - on small round base, used to denote experienced and well trained skirmisher elements. The round base shows that the element has no specific 'facing direction'</li>
			<li>OpenOrder / 2 Figure - a standard or reduced sized base with a reduced number of figures in a random arrangement. Used to denote troops that are competent at Napoleonic era open order or semi skirmisher tactics.</li>
			<li>Line / 3+ Figures - a standard sized base with a full complement of figures. Used to represent an element of close order troops in multiple ranks.</li>
		</ul>

		<p><p>
		And some additional types of bases that may also be used :
		<ul>
			<li>(Optional) Command Base - a standard sized base with a full complement of figures, including Officer, Drummer and Flag Bearer. Optionally including a command base with your Battalion allows a visual depiction of which units currently retain, or have lost their colours !</li>
			<li>(Optional) Elite / 2+ Figures - a reduced sized base with a reduced complement of figures in close order. Used to represent an elite element of close order troops in multiple ranks. This smaller base counts as a full sized element in terms of firing and close combat, so the purpose of the smaller sized base is to denote the added density of hitting power of these better troops. An example would be an attached Grenadier company in a standard Infantry Battalion.<li>
		</ul>

		<p><p>
		Each Battalion has a number of infantry element bases, which can be arranged to show the current facing and formation of the battalion on the tabletop within a grid square. Multiple bases can be arranged in sensible ways to denote march columns, lines, attack columns, squares, screens, etc.

		<p><p>
		Each Battalion can include several types of element base, depending on type of unit. When emitting elements into the Skirmish Screen, the effect is based purely on the number of bases sent into the screen, and not the number of figures in those bases.  Therefore a single figure skirmish base, a double figure open order base, and a full complement line base ... when added to the skirmish screen, all have the same Skirmisher firepower.

		<p><p>
		By carefully determining the allowed mix of element types that make up a Battalion, it is possible to model not just the size of each unit, but also the tactical doctrine, training and flexibility of that unit to a small extent.

	<div class="panel-body">
		Cavalry units operate in battle groups made up of 1 or more squadrons. Each base represents 1 squadron of cavalry.

		Multiple squadrons can be arranged in sensible ways to denote the formation of the cavalry group, including columns, lines, screens, etc.

		Artillery Batteries are made up of 1 or more sections of guns. Each gun model represents 1 section, which is generally 2 guns .. or in some rare cases 3 guns depending on the army and year of operation.

		Multiple sections can be arranged to denote condensed formation (bases touching), or spread out to represent a more open order of deployment.

	<div class="panel-body">
		It is recommended that a small number of markers are used on the tabletop to enhance the game, and increase the visual appeal of the tabletop. 
		These are generally used to denote movement and action on the tabletop. These include :
		<ul>
			<li>Smoke Markers - thin lines of cotton wool placed between intervening units, to visually show where firefights are active during a game.</li>
			<li>Fire Markers - a small columns of red black and yellow cotton wool to denote parts of the battlefield that are currently on fire.</li>
			<li>Objective Markers - Small roadside signposts, used to mark the names of objectives. If well modelled, these add to the visual impact of the game</li>
			<li>Artillery Targeting Marker - A single base with an explosion marker. For each artillery unit that is conducting targeted bombardment fire<, and explosion marker can be placed in the target grid. This shows the danger present to all units moveing through that grid.</li>
			<li>Movement Markers - Small arrow markers placed to the front of each line of battle that is currently in motion. This is used to visually distinguish
			    between units that are stationary in a grid, or that are currently moving through a grid</li>
