	<div class="panel-body">
		Unit Types are the lowest level building blocks of the armies.
		<p><p>
		There are 3 basic categories of Unit Types used in this system :
		<ul>
			<li>Infantry - where the basic unit is the Battalion, made of around 2-8 bases of troops</li>
			<li>Cavalry - where the basic unit is the Regiment, made of around 2-6 bases of horse</li>
			<li>Artillery - where the basic unit is the Battery, made of around 2-6 bases of guns</li>
		</ul>
		<p><p>
		In addition to the 3 basic unit types, additional figures on the table are used to represent 
		engineers, supply assets, and of course ... commanders.
		<p><p>
		In addition to figures, each army requires a small number of markers which are to be used on thet tabletop.
		These markers are used to represent a number of game elments such as smoke, fire, and movement markers.

	<div class="panel-heading"><h2>Figure Scale, Bases & Casualties</h2></div>
	<div class="panel-body">
		This system uses an element count figure scale instead of a strict figure based figure scale.

		<p><p>
		Each unit, be that Infantry Battalion, Cavalry Regiment, or Artillery Battery .. is made up of a number of 
		elements, which roughly equate to companies, squadrons, and gun sections. Each base of combat figures then represents a group of anything from 20-120 actual fighting men.
		<p>
			This produces the following approximate figure ratios depending on how you base your armies :
			<ul>
				<li>Empire Basing - 2 figs per company = 1:60</li>
				<li>NB Basing - 4 figs per element = 1:30 </li>
				<li>GdB Basing - 6 figs per element = 1:20</li>
			</ul>

		<p><p>
		The main point of using elements/bases rather than figures is to be able to model the different tactical doctrines of the 
		different armies in a consistent way.

		<p><p>
		<h4>Hits and Casualties</h4>

		<p>		
		All 'Hits' issued from fire, artillery or close combat represent a 10% loss of men to a single base of troops. Losses include everything from actual kills, to wounds, to stragglers, to general disorder in the ranks, and any other cause of a loss of combat proficiency.

		<p><p>
		'Hits' do not require figure or base removal. Hits that are taken by a unit are carried by that unit. Every 'Hit' that is carried by a unit will negatively effect
		the unit as a whole in pretty much all activities from morale checks, to close combat, to formation changes. 

		<p><p>
		Each unit can absorb a specific number of 'Hits' before it is forced to take remedial action. A regular / veteran unit will typically take 6 hits before it must act. Lower quality troops (conscript, etc) will typically take 5 hits before they must act. Highly elite units may take up to 7 hits before they must act. 

		<p><p>
		If at any point in the game, the unit exceeds its threshold number of hits ... then this is bad. 1 element/base must be removed, and the remaining 'Hits' on the unit is halved, rounding up. 

		<h4>First Blood</h4>

		<p><p>
		This system considers that fresh units that are as yet 'unblooded' are at best cheerfully confident. The very first hits suffered by a unit in a battle .. the 'First Blood' or 'Baptism of Fire' for each unit has an amplified effect on morale and disorder. All initial hits suffered by a unit have their negative effects doubled for the duration of that turn. 

		<p><p>
		Once a unit passes its baptism of fire, it can then be considered to have settled down and taken on a grimmer and more determined outlook .. should it pass it's initial morale checks.

		<p><p>
		<h4>Dressing the Ranks</h4>

		<p><p>
		At any point in the game, the player may spend a CommanderAction to redress a unit. This will retire 1 element/base from that unit, and recover the unit back to a state of zero hits. Only units in good morale can be redressed in this manner.  


		<p><p>
		As you can see, its up to the player how hard they wish to push their troops. If you act cautiously and redress often, the units will shrink quicker for a smaller rate of casualties. If you drive them hard and redress less often, they will take many more hits before shrinking ... but run the risk of distingrating completely if pushed too hard.

		<p><p>
		This mechanism can also be seen to address the problem where unit behavior is not always a linear function of total casualties taken. As long as the cadre of the unit remains intact, it can reorganise the unit many times to keep it on the field .. despite suffering appalling casualties. On the other hand, a sudden loss of a handful of men can create a panic that causes a good unit to break completely.  Using this mechanic, unit behavior is more closely associated with the rate of casualties suffered rather than the absolute number of casualties suffered. 

		<p><p>
		As always, YMMV, but this 'boiling frogs' model of unit behaviour in the face of casualties is intended to be in line with current thinking on this tricky matter. Hope you enjoy gaming with it !

	<div class="panel-body">
		Each ME on the tabletop requires a minimum of 1 supply element, which is used on the tabletop to show the location of the ME reserve area.
		This is typically a supply wagon, or other suitable diorama base.

<div class="panel panel-default">
	<div class="panel-heading"><h2>Infantry Models and Unit Formations</h2></div>
	<div class="panel-body">
		Infantry Battalions are made up of a number of smaller bases, each of which generally equate to a company of troops. Any consistent basing system can be used - and it is easily possible to accomodate multiple basing 'standards' in the same game, using a small degree of common sense.

		<p><p>
		3 Types of Infantry Bases should be used :
		<ul>
			<li>Full Skirmish / Single Figure - on a small round base, used to denote experienced and well trained skirmisher elements. The round base shows that the element has no specific 'facing direction'</li>
			<li>OpenOrder / 2 Figure - a standard or reduced sized base with a reduced number of figures in a random arrangement. Used to denote troops that are competent at Napoleonic era open order or semi skirmisher tactics.</li>
			<li>Line / 3+ Figures - a standard sized base with a full complement of figures. Used to represent an element of close order troops in multiple ranks.</li>
		</ul>

		<p><p>
		And some additional types of bases that may also be used :
		<ul>
			<li>(Optional) Command Base - a standard sized base with a full complement of figures, including Officer, Drummer and Flag Bearer. Optionally including a command base with your Battalion allows a visual depiction of which units currently retain, or have lost their colours !</li>
			<li>(Optional) Elite / 2+ Figures - a reduced sized base with a reduced complement of figures in close order. Used to represent an elite element of close order troops in multiple ranks. This smaller base counts as a full sized element in terms of firing and close combat, so the purpose of the smaller sized base is to denote the added density of hitting power of these better troops. An example would be an attached Grenadier company in a standard Infantry Battalion.<l/i>
		</ul>

		<p><p>
		Each Battalion has a number of infantry element bases, which can be arranged to show the current facing and formation of the battalion on the tabletop within a grid square. Multiple bases can be arranged in sensible ways to denote march columns, lines, attack columns, squares, screens, etc.

		<p><p>
		Each Battalion can include several types of element base, depending on type of unit. When emitting elements into the Skirmish Screen, the effect is based purely on the number of bases sent into the screen, and not the number of figures in those bases.  Therefore a single figure skirmish base, a double figure open order base, and a full complement line base ... when added to the skirmish screen, all have the same Skirmisher firepower.

		<p><p>
		By carefully determining the allowed mix of element types that make up a Battalion, it is possible to model not just the size of each unit, but also the tactical doctrine, training and flexibility of that unit to a small extent.

<div class="panel panel-default">
	<div class="panel-heading"><h2>Cavalry Models and Unit Formations</h2></div>
	<div class="panel-body">
		Cavalry units operate in battle groups made up of 1 or more squadrons. Each base represents 1 squadron of cavalry.

		<p><p>
		Multiple squadrons can be arranged in sensible ways to denote the formation of the cavalry group, including columns, lines, screens, etc.	
	</div>
</div>

<div class="panel panel-default">
	<div class="panel-heading"><h2>Artillery Models and Battery Formations</h2></div>
	<div class="panel-body">
		Artillery Batteries are made up of 1 or more sections of guns. Each gun model represents 1 section, which is generally 2 guns .. or in some rare cases 3 guns depending on the army and year of operation.

		<p><p>
		Multiple sections can be arranged to denote condensed formation (bases touching), or spread out to represent a more open order of deployment.

		<p><p>
		Each Artillery Battery should also have a support element, which can be a limber or ammo wagon. The position of this support model can be used to denote 
		whether the battery is limbered or deployed. If limbered, place the limber model at the head of the battery, and form the guns behind the limber in a column.
		When deployed for action, place the limber a short distance behind the gun models. If a combat result shows that the caissons explode on being hit, then place a large explosion ball of cotton wool over the support base to denote this unfortunate condition.

	<div class="panel-body">
		It is recommended that a small number of markers are used on the tabletop to enhance the game, and increase the visual appeal of the tabletop. 
		These are generally used to denote movement and dynamic action on the tabletop. These include :
		<ul>
			<li>Smoke Markers - thin lines of cotton wool placed between intervening units, to visually show where firefights are active during a game.</li>
			<li>Fire Markers - a small columns of red black and yellow cotton wool to denote parts of the battlefield that are currently on fire.</li>
			<li>Objective Markers - Small roadside signposts, used to mark the names of objectives. If well modelled, these add to the visual impact of the game</li>
			<li>Artillery Targeting Marker - A single base with an explosion marker. For each artillery unit that is conducting targeted bombardment fire, an explosion marker can be placed in the target grid. This shows the danger present to all units moving through that targetted grid.</li>
			<li>Movement Markers - Small arrow markers placed to the front of each line of battle that is currently in motion. This is used to visually distinguish
			    between units that are stationary in a grid, or that are currently moving through a grid</li>
