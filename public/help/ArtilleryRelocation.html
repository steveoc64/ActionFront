	<div class="panel-body">
		When the player wishes to move an artillery unit that is unlimbered, and part of an engaged ME, then the player must pass a relocation roll.
		This includes moving the battery, or limber and then unlimber in a new direction.

		<p><p>
		Roll 2D10, and apply the modifiers to the die roll. Cross reference the Action Required with the Artillery Class and the number of remaining horses in the battery, this provides the score needed to successfully relocate or withdraw to reserve.
