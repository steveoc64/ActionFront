	<div class="panel-body">
		Standard ground scale in Revolution and Empire is 1" = 40yds, and 1 "Turn" represents 30 minutes of elapsed time. Playing the game in fully manual control mode, the players
		move each unit about the tabletop with a resolution of inches, and use tape measures to determine ranges, etc.
		<p>
		<p>
		Using the computerized movement mode, this is simplified into a Grid system, where each Grid Square is approx 1/4 mile. When setting up the game, you can choose 
		any size grid that suits, based on the size of the battlefield and the available table space. As an effect of this, the definition of an "inch", when using the
		computerized mode, is always exactly 1/10th the size of a grid.
		<p>
		When moving troops using the computerized movement mode, the computer will track the actual movement of each unit down to the nearest "inch" within each grid.
		At various points during the game, as units progress from one "grid" to another on the virtual battlefield  ... the computer will instruct players to advance certain units
		to the next tabletop grid, etc.
		<p>
		This makes tabletop movement much faster and simpler, and avoids gamey geometry issues .. allowing players to concentrate on the general situation, and make full use of the tabletop and miniatures as an aesthetic representation, without impacting game play.
