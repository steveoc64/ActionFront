		During the Grand Tactical Movement phase, each ME that is attempting to deploy rolls 2D10, and adds the appropriate modifiers.

		<p><p>
		The results of the modified die roll are then compared with this table to arrive at a number. The resulting number is the number of deployment state changes that the ME performs.

		<p><p>
		example :  An 1809 French ME is in closed up campaign column, and is attempting to deploy in line of battle. 2D10 are rolled, getting (7,1) = 8. Add 4 for 1809 French for a total of 14.
		<p>
		Cross reference 14 with the results table, gives a result of 2.  The ME advances 2 deployment states from Closed Column .. which is Brigade Out.  So the ME can now deploy 1 brigade in line of battle, with the remainder of the ME closing up on the head of the column.
