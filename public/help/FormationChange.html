		During tactical movement, a unit may change formation as part of its movement, which in turn affects the distance that the unit may move.

		<p><p>
		To use this table, cross reference the Movement Class of the unit (Either Divisional, or Ancien Regime), with the current formation. The resultant values show the movement cost of changing formation.

		<p><p>
		The resulting number is the number of inches that the unit may continue to move.
		If the value is Zero or negative, then the following notes apply :

		<ul>
			<li>0 - Not Allowed</li>
			<li>-1 - Formation change takes entire turn, unit may fire.</li>
			<li>-2 - Formation change takes entire turn, no fire.</li>
			<li>-3 - Formation change takes entire turn, no fire and disordered.</li>
		</ul>
