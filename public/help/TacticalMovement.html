		This chart is used to define the distance in inches that units can move during tactical movement.

		<p><p>
		Tactical Movement is further influenced by the terrain type, the current weather conditions, and also the formation that the unit is in.

		<p><p>
		Each quarter mile (or 400m) Grid Square is defined as 10 inches across.  The computer will track where the unit is on the table in terms of the current grid square, and the offset in inches within that grid square. Each Grid Square is further divided into 4 quadrants, being the left/right and forward/rearward halves of the grid square.
		<p>
		Each time a unit accumulates 5 inches of tactical movement, the computer will tell the player to tactically advance the given unit(s) one quadrant within the grid square, or advance into the next grid square.

		<p><p>
		Effective medium musket range is between 50m and 150m distance. Therefore, a musket armed unit can shoot at effective range to any enemy unit in a directly adjacent grid quadrant.

		<p><p>
		Opposing units within the same grid quadrant but are not yet in base contact are deemed to be at close musket range to each other.   Opposing units that are physically in base contact with each other are deemed to be in close combat.
